This plugin is integrated with the [Grails resources plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/resources] by providing a single module definition.
This may be used by using the @<r:require />@ tag from the resources plugin in your page that uses the validation tags:

{code}
<r:require modules="jquery-validation-ui" />
{code}

This correctly inserts all the CSS and javascript required to use this plugin.
