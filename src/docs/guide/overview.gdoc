Grails [Validation|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/7.%20Validation.html] mechanism is great, I like it!  However, it is just a server side validation 
solution.  To build a comprehensive validation solution and highly interactive web application it has one missing important piece... Yes! It is client 
side validation solution that support all standard Grails constraints.  Similar grails plugins such as [Javascript Validator|http://www.grails.org/plugin/javascript-validator]
and [Remote Constraints|http://grails.org/plugin/remote-constraints] attempt to address this problem, but the outcome is less than satisfactory in my opinion. 
I like the solution and [demo|http://www.position-relative.net/creation/formValidator/] published in the blog post titled 
[A jQuery inline form validation, because validation is a mess|http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/], 
but unluckily it is not using the excellent [JQuery Validation plugin|http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/] as it's validation engine.  
It had it's own solution known as [jQuery Validation Engine|https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine].

The JQuery Validation UI Plugin brings Javascript Validator, Remote Constraints, [Custom Constraints|http://grails.org/plugin/constraints], jQuery Validation 
plugin, and [qTip (jQuery tooltip plugin)|http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip_new/] under the same root and delivers a solution that is more than the jQuery Validation Engine. 
In short, when someone asks you what the JQuery Validation UI Plugin is, just show them the following code block: 

{code}
Javascript Validator + Remote Constraints + Custom Constraints + jQuery Validation plugin + qTip 
> jQuery Validation Engine
{code}

I like the Grails's slogan: *"The search is really over!"*
